### What I like
I enjoy solving problems. I love learning new languages (most recently, I've started toying with Elixir, Go, Rust, and Clojure). I enjoy working on UI design.

### What I want to do
I want to work on a small, talented, creative team who are dedicated to craft. Support for remote-work is a must, as I get my best work done in the quiet, comfortable focus of home.
