      <h1>SQLite vs the file system</h1>
      <time class="timestamp">2022-02-12</time>
      <p>Out of curiosity, I ran a little test of SQLite vs the file system (btrfs). The conclusion? SQLite is probably faster for real-world loads.</p>
<h2 id="linear-writes">Linear writes</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was test 10k inserts, written in a tight loop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">SQLite      647ms, 809ms, 708ms
BTRFS       393ms, 371ms, 382ms
</code></pre>
<p>For sequential writes, the file system is 1.8x faster.</p>
<h2 id="concurrent-writes">Concurrent writes</h2>
<p>Next, I cranked up the concurrency and had 100 concurrent writers, each writing 1K records.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">SQLite        8.2s, 8.1s, 8.5s
BTRFS         3.1s, 3.4s, 3.4s
</code></pre>
<p>For concurrent writes, the file system is 2.4x faster.</p>
<p>This is not terribly surprising, as SQLite does not handle concurrent writes. To be honest the performance gap here is smaller than I&#39;d have guessed.</p>
<ul>
<li>SQLite can write around 12K inserts per second</li>
<li>BTRFS can write around 30K files per second</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-more-realistic-test">A more realistic test</h2>
<p>The real-world application I&#39;ll be writing would have a bit more structure and more indices. So, I think the next test will be to run N tasks from start to finish: insert, update status, update progress, delete.</p>
<p>For this, we&#39;ll want to index by status, and in the real world, I&#39;d <em>probably</em> also index by <code>scheduled_at</code> so that we can handle job scheduling efficiently. If I were to use the file system for this, I&#39;d keep the queues and schedules in memory, and rebuild it when the application starts. I&#39;ve tested the in-memory approach, and it&#39;s blisteringly fast (millions of ops per second, given proper care).</p>
<p>Concurrency: 100, each running a simulation of 100 tasks (create, change status, update &quot;output&quot; 10 times, delete):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">SQLite      11.5s, 10.3s, 7.8
BTRFS       3.3s, 3.2s, 2.4s
</code></pre>
<p>In this test, the file system was 3.3x faster than SQLite. This surprises me, since we&#39;re writing the <em>entire</em> file each time vs SQLite presumably being able to do more optimal, in-place updates (though a variety of things may mean that&#39;s not actually happening).</p>
<p>Something to note is that SQLite has quite a bit of variation in its results, and seems to get faster with time.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s try again. This time, we&#39;ll do proper file writes (write to a tmp file, rename to overwrite the current file). This should be a <em>bit</em> more crash-resistant, though for my use case, it probably doesn&#39;t matter a whole lot if one or two tasks fail due to crashes once or twice a year.</p>
<h2 id="more-resilient-file-writes">More resilient file writes</h2>
<p>Interesting. This time, I modified my file simulation to write to a tmp file first, then rename it to overwrite the existing file. This tweak caused the file simulation to be a bit slower than SQLite:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">SQLite      9.6s, 9.6s, 7.9s
BTRFS       13.5s, 13.3s, 10.2s
</code></pre>
<p>This makes me think that <em>probably</em> my initial file tests weren&#39;t waiting for fsync, but the rename forces the application to wait. I&#39;m not sure.</p>
<p>Again, SQLite seems to speed up a bit as it goes along.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another run, just with SQLite:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">SQLite ran 10k tasks 10.83936393s
SQLite ran 10k tasks 10.27817409s
SQLite ran 10k tasks 8.891015857s
SQLite ran 10k tasks 6.528546715s
SQLite ran 10k tasks 6.738008705s
SQLite ran 10k tasks 6.917476809s
</code></pre>
<p>It seems to have a warm up phase or something. My guess is that it optimizes the queries over time and / or ends up caching the execution plan after some repetition.</p>
<p>Eeeenterestink. I think that I&#39;ll give SQLite the edge here, as it will be hosted in a long-running process, and will probably end up performing on the faster-end of these ranges.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>For a my real(ish) world scenario, SQLite-- once warmed up-- is <em>roughly</em> twice as fast as the file system.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure which I&#39;ll end up going with, for my toy project, but I think it&#39;ll be SQLite. The devops part of me has a slight preference for using the file system, as I can use basic tools (grep, ls, etc) to check on things. The dev part of me definitely pefers SQLite, as I can let it take care of loads of things for me that I&#39;d otherwise have to do myself, and I can trivially query for stats, etc.</p>
